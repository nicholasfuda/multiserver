#' Simulate service times
#'
#' @description This function is useful in ensuring customers transitions through a queuing system given their arrival and service times.
#'
#' @param Arrivals The arrival time of the customer wanting to be served
#' @param ServiceTimes The amount of time a customer is served for
#' @param NumServers The number of servers available to work in the service system
#'
#' @return The server chosen to serve a particular customer along with the beginning and end of service with the chosen server.

  # Feed customers through a multiserver queue system to determine each
  # customer's transition times.

  NumCust = length(Arrivals)  #  number of customer arrivals
  # When each server is next available (this will be updated as the simulation proceeds):
  AvailableFrom <- rep(0, NumServers)
  # i.e., when the nth server will next be available

  # These variables will be filled up as the simulation proceeds:
  ChosenServer <- ServiceBegins <- ServiceEnds <- rep(0, NumCust)

  # ChosenServer = which server the ith customer will use
  # ServiceBegins = when the ith customer's service starts
  # ServiceEnds = when the ith customer's service ends

  # This loop calculates the queue system's "Transitions by Customer":

    # go to next available server
    avail <-  min(AvailableFrom)
    ChosenServer[i] <- which.min(AvailableFrom)
    # service begins as soon as server & customer are both ready
